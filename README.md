Welcome to our Flatiron Trivia Game for Mod3. Bryam and I wanted to create an interactive web application where users would be able to select an answer based on the question generated. Their points would persist on the page. If correct, a block of text would alert the user they are correct. If incorrect or if the user runs out the clock, they would lose.

Due to the nature of the API we were hoping to use, we had to seed our information into the backend, which makes our code less flexible than we hoped. Stretch features would've included a top scores board, a timer function, and more animations for the alerts.

Credits to OpenTDB for the API information we seeded, Stack Overflow for the Shuffle function we implemented, as well as W3Schools and CSS-Tricks for the CSS assistance.

Thank you for checking our repo out!
